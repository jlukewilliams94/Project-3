A friend and co-worker at the bakery, Conor Robinson, was learning how to home-brew. Chris and Tara felt like Charlotte was missing a small neighborhood brewery where folks could stop in for a pint or take home a growler of super-fresh, unfiltered, American-style ale. They invited a handful of close friends over to pitch a business plan and serve Conor’s beer, and Birdsong Brewing Company was born.",
