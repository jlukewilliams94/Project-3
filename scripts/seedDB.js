Giving back to our community and cultivating events that bring people together are also incredibly important to us. We love to celebrate and support our historic South End neighborhood. Our commitment to the environment includes donations to Catawba River clean-up, a strict recycling program at our brewery, and ensuring the spent grain (waste from the brewing process) goes to local farms which then feed their livestock with the grain.",
